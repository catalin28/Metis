Perform linguistic analysis of competitor earnings calls to identify messaging patterns that correlate with higher valuations.

**Target Company**: {target_symbol}
**Target P/E**: {target_pe}x
**Target Transcript Sample**: 
{target_transcript_sample}

**Peer Companies with Higher Multiples**:
{peer_companies_json}

**Instructions**:
Analyze earnings call transcripts to extract specific language patterns, narrative themes, and communication strategies that successful peers use to command valuation premiums. Identify what they SAY that works.

**For Each Peer Company**:

1. **Identify Core Narrative Theme**:
   - What's their central story? Examples:
     - "Tech moat" (Progressive)
     - "Global diversification" (Chubb)  
     - "Stable and boring" (Travelers)
     - "Turnaround story" (Hartford)
   - How do they position themselves?

2. **Extract Key Phrases** (3-10 exact quotes):
   - Specific words/phrases used frequently in earnings calls
   - Example: "technology platform", "data-driven insights", "telematics advantage"
   - Must be EXACT phrases, not paraphrased
   - Focus on phrases that resonate with analysts

3. **Quantify Usage Frequency**:
   - How often do they use key terms vs target company?
   - Example: "PGR uses 'technology' 34x per call vs WRB's 8x"
   - "[PEER] mentions 'global platform' Xx more than target"

4. **Measure Analyst Adoption**:
   - How often do analysts echo this narrative?
   - Example: "appears in 47% of sell-side reports"
   - "mentioned Xx more than target in analyst notes"

5. **Estimate Valuation Correlation**:
   - What P/E premium does this narrative support?
   - Example: "correlates with +6-8x P/E premium vs specialty insurers"
   - Be specific about the valuation impact

6. **Assess Steal-Ability** (50-300 characters):
   - Can target credibly adopt this narrative?
   - What would it take to reposition?
   - Example: "WRB could credibly adopt tech narrative by rebranding specialty underwriting as AI-powered risk assessment and highlighting data science team growth"

**Output Requirements**:
- **3-8 messaging patterns** from successful peers
- **Linguistic gap summary** (100-500 chars): How target's language differs from high-multiple peers
- **Priority messaging shifts** (3-5 items): Top communication changes target should make

**Analysis Focus Areas**:

1. **Technology/Innovation Language**:
   - "AI", "machine learning", "data", "analytics", "platform"
   - Frequency and context of usage

2. **Quantitative vs Qualitative**:
   - How often do they provide specific numbers in guidance?
   - Progressive: 80% of statements include specific metrics
   - Target comparison?

3. **Simplicity vs Complexity**:
   - Do they simplify or embrace complexity?
   - Jargon usage vs plain language

4. **Forward-Looking Statements**:
   - Frequency of "will", "expect", "plan" statements
   - Confidence and specificity levels

5. **Risk Framing**:
   - How do they discuss challenges/risks?
   - Defensive vs proactive positioning

**Example Output**:
```
Peer: Progressive (PGR)
P/E: Xx vs Target's Yx
Gap: +Zx

Narrative Theme: "Technology-driven data company"

Key Phrases:
- "telematics platform" (18x per call)
- "proprietary data insights" (12x per call)  
- "advanced analytics" (15x per call)
- "usage-based insurance" (22x per call)

Usage Frequency: "[PEER] uses 'technology' Nx per earnings call vs target's Mx (Xx more)"

Analyst Adoption: "Tech moat narrative appears in 47% of PGR sell-side reports vs 8% for target"

Valuation Correlation: "Tech positioning correlates with +6-8x P/E premium vs traditional specialty insurers"

Steal-Ability: "Target could credibly adopt by: (1) Rebranding specialty underwriting as AI-powered decisioning, (2) Creating quarterly 'Data & Analytics' investor update section, (3) Highlighting proprietary risk models and data science team (currently 45+ PhDs but never mentioned in earnings). Low effort, high impact."
```

**Quality Standards**:
- Use EXACT phrases from transcripts (not paraphrased)
- Provide specific frequency counts with verification
- Compare linguistic patterns across multiple peers
- Focus on patterns with demonstrated valuation correlation
- Assess realistic adoptability for target company
- Prioritize by impact potential
