Analyze hidden competitive strengths for {target_symbol} - metrics where the company excels but receives no valuation credit.

**Target Company**: {target_symbol}
**Current P/E**: {current_pe}x
**Peer Average P/E**: {peer_average_pe}x

**Peer Companies** (use these ACTUAL peer companies in your analysis, NOT made-up examples):
{peer_details}

**Underappreciated Metrics** (Target ranks #1 or #2 but has below-average P/E):
{underappreciated_metrics}

**CALCULATION ARCHITECTURE - READ CAREFULLY**:
✅ ALL MATH IS PRE-CALCULATED IN PYTHON (no LLM calculations!)
✅ Each metric includes:
   - outperformance_magnitude_calculated: EXACT comparison string from verified Python calculations
   - estimated_pe_impact: PRE-CALCULATED valuation impact estimate

❌ DO NOT recalculate ratios, percentages, or comparisons yourself
❌ DO NOT change the numbers in outperformance_magnitude_calculated
✅ USE outperformance_magnitude_calculated verbatim in your outperformance_magnitude field
✅ USE estimated_pe_impact verbatim in your valuation_impact field

**SPECIAL CASES**:
⚠️ Negative equity: If peers_excluded mentions "negative equity", note interpretability limits in narrative
⚠️ Underperformance: Some metrics may show target WORSE than peers - acknowledge this plainly if relevant
⚠️ Peer comparisons: Say what the data shows accurately - "above average but below HAS" not fabricated claims

**Your ONLY Job**: Generate narrative explanations for "why_wall_street_ignores" field

**Instructions**:
Identify 2-6 operational advantages where the target significantly outperforms peers but this strength is NOT reflected in market valuation.

**For Each Hidden Strength**:

1. **metric_name**: 
   - COPY from the metric_name field in underappreciated_metrics data

2. **target_value**:
   - COPY from the target_value field in underappreciated_metrics data

3. **peer_average**:
   - COPY from the peer_average field in underappreciated_metrics data

4. **outperformance_magnitude**: 
   - COPY the value from outperformance_magnitude_calculated EXACTLY
   - This is pre-calculated Python math - DO NOT modify or recalculate

5. **why_wall_street_ignores** (50-500 characters) - THIS IS WHERE YOU ADD VALUE:
   Explain why analysts overlook this strength. Common reasons:
   - Metric complexity / non-standard measurement
   - Buried in disclosures / poor communication
   - Analyst blind spots / coverage gaps
   - Overshadowed by other concerns (e.g., "obscured by debt concerns")
   - Industry perception biases
   - Sector rotation / out of favor narrative
   
   **ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS**:
   - If data shows "above average but below [PEER]", state that plainly
   - Don't fabricate claims of superiority that aren't in the data
   - For negative equity peers: Note "D/E comparison unreliable due to [PEER] negative equity"
   - Be specific and truthful about what the numbers actually show
   
6. **valuation_impact**:
   - COPY the value from estimated_pe_impact EXACTLY
   - This is pre-calculated valuation modeling - DO NOT modify

**Output Requirements**:
- **2-6 hidden strengths** (prioritize by impact)
- **aggregate_impact_estimate**: Valuation analysis based on current scenario:
  * **CRITICAL CHECK: Compare {current_pe} vs {peer_average_pe} FIRST**
  * **NEVER say "uplift to Xx-Yx" if stock already trades at premium (current_pe > peer_average_pe)**
  * If current P/E < peer average (trading at DISCOUNT):
    → "Total P/E uplift if all gaps closed: +X-Y% to fair value (Ax-Bx P/E)"
    → Where A-B range is ABOVE current P/E (if current Cx, use higher Ax-Bx range)
  * If current P/E > peer average (trading at PREMIUM):
    → **REQUIRED FORMAT**: "Current valuation sits ~X-Y% above the peer fair-value band (Ax-Bx P/E). Sustaining the premium requires [key differentiator], [operational strength], and [growth catalyst]."
    → Where A-B range is BELOW current P/E (peer band should be lower than current valuation)
    → **DO NOT suggest "uplift" - stock is ALREADY above fair value**
  * EXAMPLE for PREMIUM (when current_pe > peer_average_pe):
    → "Current valuation sits ~X-Y% above the peer fair-value band (Ax-Bx P/E). Sustaining the premium requires continued [competitive advantage], [profitability strength], and a return to sequential revenue growth (QoQ)."
    → NOTE: Specify "QoQ" (Quarter-over-Quarter) when mentioning revenue growth to clarify time horizon
  * EXAMPLE for DISCOUNT (when current_pe < peer_average_pe):
    → "Total P/E uplift if all gaps closed: +X-Y% to fair value (Ax-Bx P/E)"
- **communication_gap_summary** (100-500 chars): Common themes explaining why these strengths are missed

**Quality Standards for "why_wall_street_ignores"**:
- Be specific to the company and metric (not generic)
- Explain causal mechanisms for perception gaps
- Consider industry context and current market narratives
- Focus on actionable communication opportunities
- Example: "Buried in footnotes; analysts focus on top-line growth over operational efficiency in this sector"

**CRITICAL**:
- Do NOT perform any mathematical calculations yourself
- Do NOT modify pre-calculated comparison strings
- Use peer ticker symbols from the data when writing narratives
- Your value-add is explaining the "why" behind the perception gap
