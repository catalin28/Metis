**Instructions**:
Create 3-6 problem-solution frameworks that translate all analysis findings into specific, actionable recommendations. Structure as: Problem → Root Causes → Solutions → Tracking Metrics.

**Framework: DO / SAY / SHOW Categories**:
- **DO**: Actions to take (operational changes, strategic initiatives)
- **SAY**: Communication changes (messaging, narrative, language)
- **SHOW**: What to display/highlight (disclosures, presentations, metrics)

**For Each Problem**:

1. **Problem Statement** (30+ characters, as a question):
   - Example: "Why does Progressive trade at 20x when we have better metrics?"
   - Example: "How to close P/E gap from Xx to Yx?"
   - Example: "When should we execute buybacks for maximum impact?"

2. **Root Causes** (1-5 items):
   - Specific reasons why this problem exists
   - Based on analysis from previous sections
   - Example: "Limited technology narrative", "Specialty line complexity concerns"

3. **Solutions** (2-8 recommendations):
   For EACH recommendation provide:
   - **Title** (10+ chars): Clear action statement
   - **Description** (50+ chars): Detailed implementation guidance
   - **Category**: DO / SAY / SHOW
   - **Priority**: High / Medium / Low
   - **Expected Impact**: Quantified estimate (e.g., "+Xx P/E", "+Y% to fair value")
   - **Implementation Effort**: Timeline estimate ("Quick win (1-2 months)", "Medium-term (3-6 months)", "Long-term (6-12 months)")
   - **Peer Precedent** (optional): Which peer successfully did this?

4. **Tracking Metrics** (1-5 items):
   - Specific KPIs to measure progress
   - Example: "Monthly analyst mention count", "Quarterly sentiment score", "Tech keyword frequency in transcripts"

**Common Problem Categories to Address**:

1. **Valuation Gap Problems**:
   - "Why do we trade at a discount despite better fundamentals?"
   - "How to close P/E gap to peer average?"

2. **Communication Problems**:
   - "Why don't analysts understand our business model?"
   - "How to improve narrative clarity?"

3. **Strategic Timing Problems**:
   - "When should we execute buybacks?"
   - "Optimal timing for strategic announcements?"

4. **Competitive Positioning**:
   - "How to differentiate from peers?"
   - "What narrative resonates with investors?"

**Additional Output Requirements**:

1. **Priority Quick Wins** (3-5 items):
   - Highest impact, lowest effort recommendations
   - Immediate execution candidates (next 30-90 days)
   - Must include quantified impact estimate
   - Example: "Add tech terminology to next earnings call (+Xx P/E, N month effort)"

2. **Monthly Progress Framework** (100-500 chars):
   - How to track execution month-by-month
   - Progression: Messaging changes → Sentiment shifts → Analyst coverage → Multiple expansion
   - Example: "Month 1-3: Deploy new tech narrative (track: mention frequency in calls, analyst note adoption). Month 4-6: Monitor sentiment shift (track: analyst rating changes, report language). Month 7-12: Measure multiple expansion (track: P/E convergence to peers, valuation re-ratings)"

3. **Timeline to Target Multiple**:
   - Realistic timeline to close valuation gap
   - Example: "X-Y months to reach Ax-Bx P/E (vs current Cx) with consistent execution"

**Recommendation Prioritization Logic**:

**High Priority**:
- Large valuation impact (+Xx+ P/E)
- Low implementation effort (< 3 months)
- Strong peer precedent
- Addresses root cause directly

**Medium Priority**:  
- Moderate impact (+Xx-Yx P/E)
- Medium effort (3-6 months)
- Supports multiple problems

**Low Priority**:
- Smaller impact (< Xx P/E)
- High effort (6+ months)
- Nice-to-have vs critical

**Example Problem-Solution Structure**:
```
Problem: "Why does Progressive trade at 20x P/E when we have better underwriting metrics?"

Root Causes:
1. Limited technology narrative ([PEER] uses 'technology' Xx more in earnings calls)
2. Specialty line complexity perceived as higher risk
3. Insufficient quantitative guidance (WRB provides 23% fewer forward metrics than PGR)

Solutions:
[DO] Rebrand specialty underwriting division
  - Description: Rename "Specialty Lines" to "AI-Powered Risk Solutions" and create dedicated data science showcase
  - Category: DO
  - Priority: High
  - Expected Impact: +Xx P/E (close Y% of gap to [PEER])
  - Effort: Medium-term (4-6 months to fully implement)
  - Peer Precedent: Hartford's 2022 rebrand from "property & casualty" to "digital insurance platform" (+6x P/E over 24 months)

[SAY] Adopt Progressive's quantitative guidance style  
  - Description: Increase specific numerical statements in earnings calls by 80%, provide quarterly tech metrics dashboard
  - Category: SAY
  - Priority: High  
  - Expected Impact: +Xx P/E (reduces analyst uncertainty premium)
  - Effort: Quick win (implement in next earnings call, 1 month)
  - Peer Precedent: Progressive's consistent quantitative guidance correlates with 15% lower implied volatility

[SHOW] Quarterly Data & Analytics Report
  - Description: Publish 2-page quarterly summary of proprietary data assets, model performance, tech team growth
  - Category: SHOW
  - Priority: Medium
  - Expected Impact: +Xx P/E (visibility into tech capabilities)
  - Effort: Quick win (2 months to first publication)
  - Peer Precedent: Chubb's quarterly risk insights report increased institutional ownership by 12%

Tracking Metrics:
- Tech keyword frequency in earnings transcripts (target: 3x increase)
- Analyst report tech narrative adoption (target: 40% of reports mention tech/data within 6 months)
- Implied volatility vs peers (target: converge from +8% premium to peer average)
- P/E multiple convergence (target: Cx → Tx over X-Y months)
```

**Quality Standards**:
- Every recommendation must have quantified impact estimate
- Prioritization must be data-driven (not subjective)
- Timeline estimates must be realistic
- Peer precedents should be verifiable
- Track metrics must be measurable
- Focus on closing perception gaps, not fixing fundamentals
- Ensure recommendations are actionable (not aspirational)
