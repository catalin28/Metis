Validate narrative consistency and logical flow across all sections of competitive intelligence report for {symbol}.

**Report Sections to Validate:**
{executive_summary}
{hidden_strengths}
{steal_their_playbook}
{valuation_forensics}
{actionable_roadmap}

**Consistency Validation Requirements:**

1. **Cross-Section Narrative Alignment**
   - Executive summary findings supported by detailed analysis
   - Hidden strengths mentioned in recommendations
   - Valuation forensics conclusions align with executive summary
   - Messaging strategies addressed in actionable roadmap

2. **Quantitative vs Narrative Consistency**
   - Numerical claims in narratives match data tables
   - Ranking statements align with actual rankings
   - Performance comparisons use consistent metrics
   - Gap percentages mentioned consistently

3. **Logical Flow and Coherence**
   - Problem identification leads to relevant solutions
   - Recommendations address identified weaknesses
   - Success metrics align with stated objectives
   - Timeline consistency across recommendations

4. **Tone and Messaging Consistency**
   - Professional, objective tone throughout
   - Consistent confidence levels in statements
   - Balanced presentation of strengths and weaknesses
   - Actionable language in recommendations

5. **Factual Accuracy Across Sections**
   - Company names and symbols consistent
   - Financial figures match across references
   - Peer comparisons use same baseline data
   - Timeline references align

**Validation Checks:**

**Critical Inconsistencies:**
- Contradictory statements across sections
- Numerical discrepancies in cross-references
- Recommendations that contradict analysis findings
- Missing connections between problems and solutions

**Minor Issues:**
- Slight tone variations
- Redundant information across sections
- Missing cross-references where helpful
- Unclear pronoun references
