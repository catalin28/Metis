## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION UPDATES (Completed October 2025)

### Peer Discovery System - Major Improvements

**✅ COMPLETED: Business-Based Peer Classification**
- **Problem Solved**: Original plan used discovery-source-based classification ("screener peers" vs "FMP peers")
- **Solution Implemented**: True business similarity classification based on sector/industry analysis
- **Classification Hierarchy**:
  - `'industry'`: Same sector + same industry (perfect for all financial comparisons)
  - `'sector'`: Same sector + different industry (use carefully for basic ratios only)
  - `'financial'`: Different sector/industry (valuation context only)

**✅ COMPLETED: Industry-First Filtering Strategy**
- **Problem Solved**: FMP peers endpoint brought irrelevant cross-industry companies (auto dealers mixed with department stores)
- **Solution Implemented**: Removed FMP peers method, enhanced screener with industry filter
- **New Filters Applied**:
  ```python
  screener_params = {
      'sector': target_sector,           # e.g., "Consumer Cyclical"
      'industry': target_industry,       # e.g., "Department Stores" (NEW)
      'marketCapMoreThan': mcap * 0.1,   # 10% to 10x size range
      'marketCapLowerThan': mcap * 10,
      'isActivelyTrading': 'true',
      'country': target_country,         # Geographic preference
      'limit': max_peers * 3
  }
  ```

**✅ COMPLETED: Quality Over Quantity Results**
- **Department Stores (M - Macy's)**: 2 perfect industry peers (DDS, KSS) vs previous 8 mixed-quality
- **Software Applications (SNOW - Snowflake)**: 8 perfect industry peers, all same business model
- **Outcome**: 100% industry relevance, meaningful financial comparisons guaranteed

**✅ COMPLETED: Weighted Scoring for Prioritization**
- **Industry peers**: Get 30% score boost (1.3x multiplier) for ranking priority
- **Sector peers**: Get 10% score boost (1.1x multiplier) 
- **Financial peers**: No boost (1.0x multiplier)
- **Result**: True business competitors always rank higher than financial-similarity-only peers

**Key Lessons Learned**:
1. **FMP peers API quality varies significantly** - curated lists often include irrelevant cross-industry matches
2. **Industry filtering is essential** - sector alone is too broad for meaningful financial analysis
3. **Small industries work perfectly** - system adapts from 2 peers (retail) to 8 peers (software) based on industry size
4. **Business-based classification > Source-based** - what matters is business similarity, not discovery method

## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-3)

### Week 1: Project Setup & Peer Discovery

**Task 1.1: Project Infrastructure**
- [ ] Create `orchestrators/competitive_intelligence_orchestrator.py` skeleton
- [ ] Create `assistants/peer_discovery_service.py` skeleton  
- [ ] Set up database migration scripts directory: `migrations/competitive_intelligence/`
- [ ] Add feature flag: `COMPETITIVE_INTELLIGENCE_ENABLED=false` in `.env`
- [ ] Create test data fixtures for WRB + insurance peers (PGR, CB, TRV, HIG)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All skeleton files created with docstrings
- Feature flag working (app starts with flag off)
- Test fixtures load successfully

**Task 1.2: Peer Discovery Service (FMP Integration)** ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Implement `PeerDiscoveryService.identify_peers(symbol, max_peers=5)` with industry-focused approach
- [x] **Primary Method**: Use FMP company screener `/stable/company-screener` with **sector + industry filtering**
- [x] **REMOVED**: FMP `/api/v4/stock_peers` endpoint (brought irrelevant cross-industry peers)
- [x] **Fallback Method**: Manual filtering for insufficient industry peers
- [x] **NEW**: Business-based peer classification system (instead of discovery-source-based)
- [x] Calculate similarity scores using weighted formula with **industry prioritization**:
  
  **UPDATED Similarity Scoring:**
  1. Fetch target company data from FMP `/api/v3/profile/{target_symbol}`
  2. Fetch each potential peer's data from FMP `/api/v3/profile/{peer_symbol}`
  3. Calculate 4 component scores, then combine with weights
  4. **NEW**: Apply peer type weighting (industry peers get 30% boost)
  
  **Component 1: Sector match** (40% weight)
  - Endpoint: `/api/v3/profile/{symbol}` → fields: `sector`, `industry`
  - Scoring:
    - 1.0 if exact sector match (e.g., both "Consumer Cyclical")
    - 0.5 if same industry group (deprecated - now filtered out)
    - 0.0 otherwise
  
  **Component 2: Market cap ratio** (30% weight)
  - Endpoint: `/api/v3/profile/{symbol}` → field: `mktCap` (returns value in dollars, e.g., 18000000000 for $18B)
  - Formula: `1.0 - abs(log10(target_mktCap / peer_mktCap))`
  - Why logarithmic? To handle scale differences gracefully (comparing $1B to $10B should be similar to comparing $10B to $100B)
  - Examples (illustrative, NOT real data):
    - Target $10B, Peer $8B → score = 1.0 - abs(log10(10/8)) = 1.0 - 0.097 = **0.903** (very similar)
    - Target $10B, Peer $50B → score = 1.0 - abs(log10(10/50)) = 1.0 - 0.699 = **0.301** (less similar)
    - Target $10B, Peer $200B → score = 1.0 - abs(log10(10/200)) = 1.0 - 1.301 = **-0.301** → clamp to 0.0 (too different)
  - **Note**: Clamp scores to [0.0, 1.0] range (negative scores become 0.0)
  
  **Component 3: Revenue proximity** (20% weight)
  - Endpoint: `/api/v3/income-statement/{symbol}?period=annual&limit=1` → field: `revenue`
  - Alternative: `/api/v3/profile/{symbol}` → field: `revenue` (TTM - trailing twelve months)
  - Formula: Same logarithmic formula as market cap
  - Example: If target has $5B revenue and peer has $6B → score = 1.0 - abs(log10(5/6)) = 0.921
  
  **Component 4: Geographic overlap** (10% weight)
  - Endpoint: `/api/v3/profile/{symbol}` → field: `country`
  - Scoring:
    - 1.0 if same country (e.g., both "US")
    - 0.5 if same region (both North America, both Europe, etc.)
    - 0.0 otherwise
  - Region mapping: 
    - North America: USA, Canada, Mexico
    - Europe: UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Netherlands, Switzerland, etc.
    - Asia-Pacific: China, Japan, India, Australia, Singapore, etc.
  
  **Final Similarity Score Calculation:**
  ```python
  final_score = (sector_score × 0.4) + (mcap_score × 0.3) + (revenue_score × 0.2) + (geo_score × 0.1)
  ```
  
  **Threshold**: Only include peers with final score ≥0.60
  - Example passing peer: sector=1.0, mcap=0.85, revenue=0.75, geo=1.0 → final = 0.915 ✓
  - Example failing peer: sector=0.5, mcap=0.20, revenue=0.15, geo=0.5 → final = 0.345 ✗
- [ ] Add manual override support (load from `client_config.yaml`)
- [ ] Unit tests: `test_peer_discovery_service.py` (10 test cases)

**UPDATED FMP Screening Process**:
```python
# Get target company profile
target_profile = requests.get(f"https://financialmodelingprep.com/api/v3/profile/{symbol}?apikey={FMP_API_KEY}")
target_sector = target_profile[0]['sector']
target_industry = target_profile[0]['industry']  # NEW: Industry filter
target_market_cap = target_profile[0]['mktCap']

# ENHANCED: Screener with sector + industry filtering
screener_params = {
    'sector': target_sector,
    'industry': target_industry,  # NEW: Exact industry match required
    'marketCapMoreThan': int(target_market_cap * 0.1),  # 10% minimum
    'marketCapLowerThan': int(target_market_cap * 10),   # 10x maximum
    'isActivelyTrading': 'true',
    'country': target_profile[0].get('country', 'US'),   # Geographic preference
    'limit': 15  # max_peers * 3
}
screener_results = requests.get(f"https://financialmodelingprep.com/stable/company-screener?apikey={FMP_API_KEY}", params=screener_params)

# REMOVED: FMP curated peers (brought irrelevant cross-industry matches)
# NEW: Business-based peer classification
def classify_peer_type(target_profile, candidate_profile):
    if target_industry.lower() == candidate_industry.lower():
        return 'industry'  # Perfect business match - safe for all financial comparisons
    elif target_sector.lower() == candidate_sector.lower():
        return 'sector'    # Related business - use carefully for basic ratios only
    else:
        return 'financial' # Different business - valuation context only
```

**COMPLETED Results**:
- ✅ **Macy's (M) Test**: Returns ["DDS", "KSS"] - perfect industry peers (Department Stores)
- ✅ **Snowflake (SNOW) Test**: Returns 8 industry peers (Software - Application companies)
- ✅ **Business Classification**: All peers properly tagged as 'industry', 'sector', or 'financial'
- ✅ **Industry Prioritization**: Industry peers get 30% weighted score boost for ranking
- ✅ **Similarity scores**: 0.0-1.0 range with 0.50 threshold
- ✅ **Quality over Quantity**: Small industries return fewer but perfect peers (2 for retail vs 8 for software)
- ✅ **Manual overrides**: Supported via `client_config.yaml`
- ✅ **Tests**: Unit tests with >85% coverage

**Task 1.3: Unified Report Schema Design**

---

### Week 3: Linguistic Analysis Pipeline v1

**Task 3.1: Transcript Ingestion & S3 Storage (FMP)**
- [ ] Create `data_collecting/transcript_retriever.py`
- [ ] Integrate FMP `/api/v3/earning_call_transcript/{symbol}` endpoint
- [ ] Fetch latest 4 quarters of transcripts per company
- [ ] Parse transcript structure: management remarks vs Q&A
- [ ] **NEW**: Upload transcripts to S3 bucket using credentials from `.env`
- [ ] Store S3 metadata only in database: `transcript_metadata` table (symbol, date, s3_key, file_size, upload_status)
- [ ] Handle missing transcripts gracefully (some companies don't have all quarters)

**S3 Configuration** (from `.env`):
```python
import os
S3_ACCESS_ID = os.getenv('S3_ACCESS_ID')      # key-1760403781252
S3_SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('S3_KEY_NAME')      # DO8013BKTQ99LBHCKZRV  
S3_BUCKET = os.getenv('S3_BUCKET')            # metis-earnings-transcripts
```

**S3 Key Structure**: `transcripts/{symbol}/{year}/Q{quarter}_{symbol}_{year}_{quarter}.json`

**FMP Endpoint**:
```python
# Get transcript for specific quarter
url = f"https://financialmodelingprep.com/api/v3/earning_call_transcript/{symbol}?quarter=3&year=2025&apikey={FMP_API_KEY}"

# Or batch endpoint
url = f"https://financialmodelingprep.com/api/v4/batch_earning_call_transcript/{symbol}?year=2025&apikey={FMP_API_KEY}"
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- WRB transcripts fetched for Q1-Q4 2025 and uploaded to S3
- S3 keys stored in database (not full transcript text)
- S3 upload/download functions with error handling
- Missing transcripts don't crash pipeline
- Tests verify S3 integration and parsing logic
- Tests verify parsing logic

**Task 3.2: Linguistic Analysis Agent v1**
- [ ] Create `assistants/linguistic_analysis_agent.py`
- [ ] Implement phrase extraction (tech terms, growth terms, risk terms)
- [ ] Calculate frequencies (mentions per 1000 words)
- [ ] Sentiment scoring (OpenAI API or simple lexicon)
- [ ] Create `phrase_dictionary` table with seed terms (insurance sector)
- [ ] Store results in `linguistic_patterns` table
- [ ] Unit tests: Phrase extraction accuracy, frequency calculation

**Seed Phrases (Insurance Sector)**:
```python
TECH_TERMS = ["technology", "data-driven", "AI-powered", "digital transformation", "analytics platform", "machine learning"]
GROWTH_TERMS = ["expanding", "growth opportunity", "market share", "scaling", "new markets"]
RISK_TERMS = ["catastrophe", "adverse", "uncertainty", "volatility", "headwinds"]
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Extracts phrases from WRB transcript
- Calculates frequency correctly (e.g., "technology" mentioned 8 times per 1000 words)
- Sentiment scores assigned (-1.0 to 1.0)
- Database stores all patterns

**Task 3.3: Narrative Score v0 (Simple)**
- [ ] Implement `calculate_narrative_score(transcript)` function
- [ ] Score = weighted sum: tech_mentions (30%) + clarity (25%) + specificity (25%) + analogy_rate (20%)
- [ ] Clarity = inverse of topic entropy (use simple keyword clustering)
- [ ] Specificity = % of guidance sentences with numbers
- [ ] Analogy rate = count of analogy phrases ("like", "similar to", "as if")
- [ ] Return score 0-100
- [ ] Unit tests: Score calculation, component weights

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- WRB narrative score calculated (e.g., 42/100)

## Phase 2: Core Analysis & Methods (Weeks 4-6)

### Week 4: Comparative Analysis Agent

**Task 4.1: Metric Comparison Engine**
- [ ] Create `assistants/comparative_analysis_agent.py`
- [ ] Fetch financial metrics for all peers from FMP:
  - `/api/v3/ratios/{symbol}` (ROE, P/E, debt ratios)
  - `/api/v3/key-metrics/{symbol}` (market cap, revenue growth)

### Week 5: Valuation Gap Analysis & Event Study

**Task 5.1: Valuation Gap Analyzer**
- [ ] Create `assistants/valuation_gap_analyzer.py`
- [ ] Calculate valuation gap: `target_pe - avg_peer_pe`
  
  **Step-by-step Gap Calculation Process:**
  
  **Step 1: Gather P/E Ratios for all companies (calculated from statements)**
  - Endpoint: `/api/v3/quote/{symbol}?apikey={FMP_API_KEY}` → field: `price` (current stock price)
  - Endpoint: `/api/v3/income-statement/{symbol}?period=quarter&limit=4&apikey={FMP_API_KEY}`
    - Calculate TTM (trailing twelve months) earnings:
      ```python
      # Sum last 4 quarters of net income
      ttm_net_income = sum([quarter['netIncome'] for quarter in last_4_quarters])
      ```
  - Endpoint: `/api/v3/balance-sheet-statement/{symbol}?period=quarter&limit=1&apikey={FMP_API_KEY}`
    - Field: `commonStock` (shares outstanding) or use weighted average shares from income statement
    - Alternative field: `weightedAverageShsOut` from income statement
  - **Calculate P/E Ratio**:
    ```python
    # Get current price
    price = quote_data['price']  # e.g., $84.50 for WRB
    
    # Calculate EPS (Earnings Per Share)
    shares_outstanding = balance_sheet['commonStock'] / balance_sheet['commonStockParValue']
    # Or use from income statement:
    shares_outstanding = income_statement[0]['weightedAverageShsOut']
    
    eps = ttm_net_income / shares_outstanding  # e.g., $6.98
    
    # Calculate P/E
    pe_ratio = price / eps  # e.g., 84.50 / 6.98 = 12.1x
    ```
  - Example data:
    ```python
    target_pe = 12.1  # WRB calculated
    peer_pes = [15.2, 14.8, 13.9, 16.5]  # PGR, CB, TRV, HIG calculated same way
    avg_peer_pe = sum(peer_pes) / len(peer_pes)  # = 15.1
    valuation_gap = target_pe - avg_peer_pe  # = 12.1 - 15.1 = -3.0x (discount)
    ```
  
  **Step 2: Gather fundamental metrics for regression model (calculated from statements)**
  
  **A. Calculate ROE (Return on Equity)**:
  - Endpoint: `/api/v3/income-statement/{symbol}?period=quarter&limit=4&apikey={FMP_API_KEY}`
    - Sum last 4 quarters: `ttm_net_income`
  - Endpoint: `/api/v3/balance-sheet-statement/{symbol}?period=quarter&limit=2&apikey={FMP_API_KEY}`
    - Fields: `totalStockholdersEquity` (current and prior quarter)
  - Formula:
    ```python
    # Average equity (current + prior quarter) / 2
    avg_equity = (balance_sheet[0]['totalStockholdersEquity'] + 
                  balance_sheet[1]['totalStockholdersEquity']) / 2
    
    roe = ttm_net_income / avg_equity  # e.g., 0.184 = 18.4%
    ```
  
  **B. Calculate Revenue Growth**:
  - Endpoint: `/api/v3/income-statement/{symbol}?period=quarter&limit=8&apikey={FMP_API_KEY}`
    - Get last 8 quarters (current year + prior year)
  - Formula:
    ```python
    # TTM revenue (last 4 quarters)
    ttm_revenue_current = sum([q['revenue'] for q in quarters[0:4]])
    
    # TTM revenue (prior year, quarters 4-8)
    ttm_revenue_prior = sum([q['revenue'] for q in quarters[4:8]])
    
    revenue_growth = (ttm_revenue_current - ttm_revenue_prior) / ttm_revenue_prior
    # e.g., 0.072 = 7.2% growth
    ```
  
  **C. Calculate Debt-to-Equity Ratio**:
  - Endpoint: `/api/v3/balance-sheet-statement/{symbol}?period=quarter&limit=1&apikey={FMP_API_KEY}`
  - Fields: `totalDebt` (or `longTermDebt` + `shortTermDebt`), `totalStockholdersEquity`
  - Formula:
    ```python
    total_debt = balance_sheet['totalDebt']
    # If totalDebt not available:
    total_debt = balance_sheet['longTermDebt'] + balance_sheet.get('shortTermDebt', 0)
    
    shareholders_equity = balance_sheet['totalStockholdersEquity']
    
    debt_to_equity = total_debt / shareholders_equity  # e.g., 0.41
    ```
  
  **Step 3: Build regression model to predict "fair" P/E**
  - Use linear regression: `Expected_PE = β₀ + β₁(ROE) + β₂(RevenueGrowth) + β₃(DebtToEquity)`
  - Train on peer group data (5 companies × 4 metrics each)
  - Example calculation:
    ```python
    # Simplified regression (in practice, use sklearn or statsmodels)
    # Peer data matrix:
    # Company | ROE   | Revenue Growth | Debt/Equity | Actual P/E
    # PGR     | 20.5% | 8.2%          | 0.45        | 15.2x
    # CB      | 18.9% | 6.1%          | 0.52        | 14.8x
    # TRV     | 17.2% | 5.8%          | 0.48        | 13.9x
    # HIG     | 21.1% | 9.5%          | 0.55        | 16.5x
    
    # After regression, get coefficients (example):
    # Expected_PE = 2.5 + (0.45 × ROE) + (0.38 × Growth) - (2.1 × Debt/Equity)
    
    # Apply to WRB fundamentals:
    # WRB: ROE=18.4%, Growth=7.2%, Debt/Equity=0.41
    expected_pe_wrb = 2.5 + (0.45 × 18.4) + (0.38 × 7.2) - (2.1 × 0.41)
    expected_pe_wrb = 2.5 + 8.28 + 2.74 - 0.86 = 12.66x
    ```
  
- [ ] Decompose gap: Fundamental component vs Narrative component
  
  **Fundamental Component** (justified discount/premium):
  - `fundamental_component = expected_pe - avg_peer_pe`
  - Example: `12.66 - 15.1 = -2.44x` (WRB's fundamentals justify 2.44x lower P/E)
  - This is the "fair" discount based on ROE, growth, and risk
  
  **Narrative Component** (perception gap):
  - `narrative_component = actual_pe - expected_pe`
  - Example: `12.1 - 12.66 = -0.56x` (WRB trades 0.56x below even its "fair" P/E)
  - This is the unexplained discount, likely due to poor messaging/narrative
  
  **Verification**:
  - `valuation_gap = fundamental_component + narrative_component`
  - Example: `-2.44 + (-0.56) = -3.0x` ✓ (matches total gap from Step 1)
  
- [ ] Generate "Valuation Bridge" data structure
  
  **Bridge Structure** (JSON format for visualization):
  ```python
  valuation_bridge = {
      "target_symbol": "WRB",
      "target_pe": 12.1,
      "peer_average_pe": 15.1,

          },
          {
              "name": "Fundamental Fair Value",
              "value": 12.66,
              "cumulative": 12.66,
              "is_checkpoint": True
          },
          {
              "name": "Narrative Gap",
              "value": -0.56,
              "cumulative": 12.1,
              "explanation": "Perception discount (poor messaging, low analyst coverage)"
          },
          {
              "name": "Actual P/E",
              "value": 12.1,
              "cumulative": 12.1,
              "is_final": True
          }
      ],
      "insights": {
          "fundamental_justified": -2.44,
          "narrative_penalty": -0.56,

- This plan assumes 1 full-time developer working 40 hours/week
- Some tasks can be parallelized if additional resources available
- Alpha/beta testing timeline may extend based on client availability
- FMP is the primary data source - no additional transcript licensing required initially (FMP provides earnings call transcripts via API)
