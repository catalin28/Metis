That valuation premium sits alongside only modest analyst momentum: 4 recent actions (1 upgrade, 3 maintains) and a Neutral consensus. Coverage is slightly narrower (8 firms vs peer avg ~9), so the premium appears driven more by market positioning than by broad upward analyst revision. With the dashboard showing \"No major fundamental advantages identified,\" the divergence\u2014premium valuation plus neutral sentiment and limited coverage\u2014creates a conditional perception gap: ASML may be vulnerable if it cannot demonstrate clearer growth or margin catalysts, yet stands as a contrarian setup only if future order/margin evidence justifies the premium.",
