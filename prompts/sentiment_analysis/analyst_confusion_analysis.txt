**Q&A Section**:

**Instructions**:
Analyze the Q&A interaction between analysts and management to identify confusion, uncertainty, and communication clarity issues. Higher scores indicate MORE confusion/uncertainty (0 = very clear, 100 = highly confused).

**Scoring Framework**:
1. **QUESTION_COMPLEXITY (0-100)**: How complex, multi-part, or clarification-seeking are the questions?
   - 90-100: Highly complex, multi-layered questions with multiple clarification requests
   - 70-89: Complex questions with some follow-up clarifications needed
   - 50-69: Moderately complex questions with occasional clarifications
   - 30-49: Straightforward questions with minimal complexity
   - 0-29: Simple, direct questions that are easy to understand

2. **CLARIFICATION_FREQUENCY (0-100)**: How often do analysts ask follow-ups or request clarification?
   - 90-100: Frequent "can you clarify", "what do you mean by", "I'm confused about"
   - 70-89: Regular clarification requests and follow-up questions
   - 50-69: Some clarification requests but not excessive
   - 30-49: Occasional clarification needed
   - 0-29: Analysts rarely need clarification

3. **RESPONSE_AMBIGUITY (0-100)**: How vague, lengthy, or evasive are management responses?
   - 90-100: Very long, circuitous responses that don't directly answer questions
   - 70-89: Somewhat lengthy responses with some evasion
   - 50-69: Moderately clear responses with some ambiguity
   - 30-49: Generally clear responses with minor ambiguity
   - 0-29: Clear, direct, specific responses

4. **UNCERTAINTY_LANGUAGE (0-100)**: How much uncertainty language appears in both questions and responses?
   - 90-100: Frequent use of "I think", "maybe", "unclear", "confused", "uncertain"
   - 70-89: Regular uncertainty indicators in conversation
   - 50-69: Some uncertainty language present
   - 30-49: Minimal uncertainty indicators
   - 0-29: Confident, certain language throughout

**Analysis Guidelines**:
- Count actual instances of confusion indicators
- Look for patterns of misunderstanding
- Identify topics that generate the most questions
- Note when analysts ask the same question multiple ways
- Consider the overall flow and clarity of the Q&A session
- Weight substantive confusion higher than minor clarifications
