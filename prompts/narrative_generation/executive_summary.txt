Generate a comprehensive executive summary for the competitive intelligence report on {symbol}.

**Report Context**:
- Target Company: {symbol} ({company_name})
- Industry: {industry}
- Report Date: {report_date}
- Number of Peers Analyzed: {peer_count}

**Key Financial Data**:
- Market Cap: ${market_cap:,.0f}
- Current P/E Ratio: {current_pe}x
- Peer Average P/E: {peer_average_pe}x
- Valuation Gap: {valuation_gap}x ({gap_percentage}%)
- Target ROE: {target_roe}%
- Peer Average ROE: {peer_average_roe}%
- Target Combined Ratio: {target_combined_ratio}
- Peer Average Combined Ratio: {peer_combined_ratio}

**Valuation Math Guide** (for recommendations with market cap impact):
- Formula: Market Cap Impact = (Target P/E / Current P/E - 1) × Current Market Cap
- Current Scenario: {valuation_direction} valuation (Current P/E: {current_pe}x vs Peer Avg: {target_pe}x)
- REQUIRED: All P/E rerate recommendations MUST target {target_pe}x (from analysis)
- Calculation for {target_pe}x rerate: ({target_pe} / {current_pe} - 1) × ${market_cap:,.0f} = ${target_market_cap_change:,.2f} ({target_gap_percentage:.1f}%)
- CRITICAL DIRECTION LOGIC:
  * If {valuation_direction} = "premium": Rerate to {target_pe}x means DECREASE in market cap (use "would imply ~{target_gap_percentage:.1f}% downside" or "requires fundamentals to improve to justify premium")
  * If {valuation_direction} = "discount": Rerate to {target_pe}x means INCREASE in market cap (use "potentially increasing market cap by ${target_market_cap_change:,.2f} (+{target_gap_percentage:.1f}%)")
- Alternative scenarios (if needed):
  * 18x scenario: (18 / {current_pe} - 1) × ${market_cap:,.0f}
  * 20x scenario: (20 / {current_pe} - 1) × ${market_cap:,.0f}
- DO NOT use arbitrary P/E targets—use {target_pe}x as primary recommendation

**Competitive Position Data**:
- Target Company Rank: {target_rank} out of {peer_count} companies
- Areas of Excellence: {areas_of_excellence}
- Areas Needing Improvement: {areas_of_improvement}
- Perception Gaps Identified: {perception_gaps}

**Instructions**:
Create an executive-level summary that synthesizes the competitive analysis findings into clear, actionable insights. The summary should be suitable for C-suite executives and board members.

**Required Components**:

1. **Company Overview** (200-400 words):
   - Brief description of the company's business model and market position
   - Current competitive standing within the industry
   - Key operational strengths and market opportunities
   - ACCURACY: When citing ROE, say "above peer average" NOT "outperforming peers" (a peer may be higher)
   - CRITICAL RANKING RULES:
     * DO NOT use "#1 (tied)" unless multiple companies have the EXACT SAME numerical value
     * If target is clearly #1 with best value, say "ranks #1" without qualification
     * Only add "(tied)" when values are mathematically identical (e.g., both have X.XX%)
     * Example: ROE X.XX% vs peers Y.YY%, Z.ZZ%, -W.WW% = "ranks #1 in ROE" NOT "#1 (tied)"

2. **Key Finding** (100-200 words):
   - Primary valuation insight with specific numbers
   - When stating P/E gaps, use "P/E points" not "x" (e.g., "X.XX P/E points (~Y.Y% premium)" NOT "X.XXx")
   - Root cause of any valuation gaps identified
   - Significance of the finding for the company's strategic positioning

3. **Root Cause Analysis** (50-150 words):
   - Number and nature of perception gaps identified
   - Underlying factors driving market misperception
   - Communication or operational issues affecting valuation

4. **Top Recommendations** (EXACTLY 3 bullet points):
   - Highest-impact actions to address valuation gaps
   - ALL recommendations must target {target_pe}x P/E rerate (from {current_pe}x)
   - CRITICAL VALUATION LANGUAGE:
     * For PREMIUM stocks (current P/E > peer average): Use "sustaining the premium requires..." or "if multiple compresses to peer average, would imply ~X% downside"
     * For DISCOUNT stocks (current P/E < peer average): Use "rerate could increase market cap by $X (+Y%)"
     * NEVER say "increase market cap by $-XXB" or use mixed signs like "(+X%)" with negative dollars
   - CRITICAL DIRECTION ENFORCEMENT (CHECK EVERY RECOMMENDATION):
     * If {valuation_direction} = "premium" (current P/E > target P/E):
       ✓ CORRECT: "...would imply ~{target_gap_percentage:.1f}% downside from current levels unless fundamentals improve"
       ✓ CORRECT: "...requires fundamental improvements to sustain premium, otherwise ~{target_gap_percentage:.1f}% downside risk"
       ✗ WRONG: "...could increase market cap by ${target_market_cap_change:,.2f}"
       ✗ WRONG: "...potentially increasing market cap"
     * If {valuation_direction} = "discount" (current P/E < target P/E):
       ✓ CORRECT: "...potentially increasing market cap by ${target_market_cap_change:,.2f} (+{target_gap_percentage:.1f}%)"
   - VERIFY: Read each recommendation and confirm direction matches {valuation_direction}
   - Include timeline, specific actions, and KPIs to measure progress
   - Focus on: investor communications, IR programs, disclosure quality improvements, fundamental improvements (if premium)
   - IMPORTANT: Provide EXACTLY 3 recommendations, no more, no less

**Tone and Style**:
- Executive-level language (avoid technical jargon)
- Data-driven insights with specific metrics
- Action-oriented recommendations
- Confident but balanced assessment
- Industry-appropriate terminology
