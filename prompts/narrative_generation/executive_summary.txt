Generate a comprehensive executive summary for the competitive intelligence report on {symbol}.

**Report Context**:
- Target Company: {symbol} ({company_name})
- Industry: {industry}
- Report Date: {report_date}
- Number of Peers Analyzed: {peer_count}

**Key Financial Data**:
- Market Cap: ${market_cap:,.0f}
- Current P/E Ratio: {current_pe}x
- Peer Average P/E: {peer_average_pe}x
- Valuation Gap: {valuation_gap}x ({gap_percentage}%)
- Target ROE: {target_roe_formatted} (raw: {target_roe})
- Peer Average ROE: {peer_average_roe_formatted} (raw: {peer_average_roe})
- Target Combined Ratio: {target_combined_ratio}
- Peer Average Combined Ratio: {peer_combined_ratio}

**IMPORTANT**: When mentioning ROE in narrative, use the formatted versions (e.g., "ROE of ~13.0%"), NOT the raw decimal values

**Valuation Math Guide** (for recommendations with market cap impact):
- Formula: Market Cap Impact = (Target P/E / Current P/E - 1) × Current Market Cap
- Current Scenario: {valuation_direction} valuation (Current P/E: {current_pe}x vs Peer Avg: {target_pe}x)
- REQUIRED: All P/E rerate recommendations MUST target {target_pe}x (from analysis)
- Calculation for {target_pe}x rerate: ({target_pe} / {current_pe} - 1) × ${market_cap:,.0f} = ${target_market_cap_change:,.2f} ({target_gap_percentage:.1f}%)
- CRITICAL DIRECTION LOGIC:
  * If {valuation_direction} = "premium": Rerate to {target_pe}x means DECREASE in market cap (use "would imply ~{target_gap_percentage:.1f}% downside" or "requires fundamentals to improve to justify premium")
  * If {valuation_direction} = "discount": Rerate to {target_pe}x means INCREASE in market cap (use "potentially increasing market cap by ${target_market_cap_change:,.2f} (+{target_gap_percentage:.1f}%)")
- Alternative scenarios (if needed):
  * 18x scenario: (18 / {current_pe} - 1) × ${market_cap:,.0f}
  * 20x scenario: (20 / {current_pe} - 1) × ${market_cap:,.0f}
- DO NOT use arbitrary P/E targets—use {target_pe}x as primary recommendation

**Competitive Position Data**:
- Target Company Rank: {target_rank} out of {peer_count} companies
- Areas of Excellence: {areas_of_excellence}
- Areas Needing Improvement: {areas_of_improvement}
- Perception Gaps Count: {perception_gap_count}
- Perception Gaps Identified: {perception_gaps}
- CRITICAL: If any list has fewer than 3 items, use only the items provided - DO NOT add meta-text like "a third item was not provided"
- Example: If only 2 weaknesses provided, mention only those 2 naturally without explaining why there's no third

**Instructions**:
Create an executive-level summary that synthesizes the competitive analysis findings into clear, actionable insights. The summary should be suitable for C-suite executives and board members.

**Required Components**:

1. **Company Overview** (200-400 words):
   - Brief description of the company's business model and market position
   - CRITICAL: Overall competitive standing = #{target_rank} out of {peer_count} peers (USE THIS EXACT NUMBER)
   - DO NOT say "#1 overall" unless {target_rank} = 1
   - DO NOT say "#2 overall" unless {target_rank} = 2
   - If {target_rank} = 2, you MUST say "ranks #2 overall" or "second-ranked overall"
   - Key operational strengths and market opportunities
   - ACCURACY: When citing ROE, say "above peer average" NOT "outperforming peers" (a peer may be higher)
   - CRITICAL OVERALL RANKING RULE:
     * ALWAYS use the provided {target_rank} when describing overall competitive position
     * DO NOT infer rankings from individual metrics like "ranks #1 overall" if {target_rank} ≠ 1
     * Example: "ranks #{target_rank} overall among {peer_count} peers in our comparative analysis"
   - CRITICAL METRIC-SPECIFIC RANKING RULES:
     * For individual metrics (ROE, P/E, revenue growth), you may say "ranks #1 in ROE" if actually best in that metric
     * When mentioning revenue growth, ALWAYS specify "Revenue Growth (QoQ)" to clarify time horizon (Quarter-over-Quarter)
     * DO NOT use "#1 (tied)" unless multiple companies have EXACT SAME numerical value
     * Only add "(tied)" when values are mathematically identical (e.g., both have 13.45%)
     * Example: ROE X.XX% vs peers Y.YY%, Z.ZZ%, -W.WW% = "ranks #1 in ROE" NOT "#1 (tied)" unless tied

2. **Key Finding** (100-200 words):
   - Primary valuation insight with specific numbers
   - When stating P/E gaps, use "P/E points" not "x" (e.g., "X.XX P/E points (~Y.Y% premium)" NOT "X.XXx")
   - Root cause of any valuation gaps identified
   - Significance of the finding for the company's strategic positioning

3. **Root Cause Analysis** (50-150 words):
   - Number and nature of perception gaps identified - ALWAYS use {perception_gap_count}
   - If {perception_gap_count} = 0: "No explicit perception gaps identified. The observed premium/discount appears driven by fundamentals..."
   - If {perception_gap_count} = 1: "{perception_gap_count} perception gap identified: [describe the specific gap and its impact]"
   - If {perception_gap_count} >= 2: "{perception_gap_count} perception gaps are present: [enumerate and briefly explain each gap with impact]"
   - DO NOT count {perception_gaps} list manually - ALWAYS use {perception_gap_count} variable
   - DO NOT say "No gaps" or "0 perception gaps" if {perception_gap_count} > 0
   - If gaps exist, enumerate them with brief explanations: "(1) [gap name + metric], (2) [gap name + metric], etc."
   - Underlying factors driving market misperception
   - Communication or operational issues affecting valuation
   - Connect perception gaps to valuation impact: how do these gaps contribute to the P/E discount/premium?

4. **Top Recommendations** (EXACTLY 3 bullet points):
   - Highest-impact actions to address valuation gaps
   - ALL recommendations must target {target_pe}x P/E rerate (from {current_pe}x)
   - CRITICAL VALUATION LANGUAGE:
     * For PREMIUM stocks (current P/E > peer average): Use "sustaining the premium requires..." or "if multiple compresses to peer average, would imply ~X% downside"
     * For DISCOUNT stocks (current P/E < peer average): Use "rerate could increase market cap by $X (+Y%)"
     * NEVER say "increase market cap by $-XXB" or use mixed signs like "(+X%)" with negative dollars
   - CRITICAL DIRECTION ENFORCEMENT (CHECK EVERY RECOMMENDATION):
     * If {valuation_direction} = "premium" (current P/E > target P/E):
       ✓ CORRECT: "...would imply ~{target_gap_percentage:.1f}% downside from current levels unless fundamentals improve"
       ✓ CORRECT: "...requires fundamental improvements to sustain premium, otherwise ~{target_gap_percentage:.1f}% downside risk"
       ✗ WRONG: "...could increase market cap by ${target_market_cap_change:,.2f}"
       ✗ WRONG: "...potentially increasing market cap"
     * If {valuation_direction} = "discount" (current P/E < target P/E):
       ✓ CORRECT: "...potentially increasing market cap by ${target_market_cap_change:,.2f} (+{target_gap_percentage:.1f}%)"
   - VERIFY: Read each recommendation and confirm direction matches {valuation_direction}
   - Include timeline, specific actions, and KPIs to measure progress
   - Focus on: investor communications, IR programs, disclosure quality improvements, fundamental improvements (if premium)
   - IMPORTANT: Provide EXACTLY 3 recommendations, no more, no less

**Tone and Style**:
- Executive-level language (avoid technical jargon)
- Data-driven insights with specific metrics
- Action-oriented recommendations
- Confident but balanced assessment
- Industry-appropriate terminology

**Required Output Format** (JSON):
```json
