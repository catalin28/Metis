## YOUR TASK

Generate a comprehensive swing trading analysis report with the following structure. **IMPORTANT**: Focus ONLY on comparisons with the peer companies listed above. Do NOT compare with any other companies or make external references.

### REQUIRED SECTIONS:

1. **Executive Summary (2-3 paragraphs)**
   - Identify if the company is overvalued, undervalued, or fairly valued based on P/E premium/discount
   - Highlight the key trading thesis (compression risk, breakout opportunity, or wait-and-see)
   - State the primary risk/reward setup

2. **Valuation Reality Check**
   - List the P/E multiples for target and ALL peers in descending order (most expensive to cheapest)
   - Calculate and state downside scenarios:
     * If target re-rates to peer average: X% downside
     * If target re-rates to closest peer: Y% downside
     * If target re-rates to cheapest peer: Z% downside
   - Identify if current valuation is sustainable or at risk

3. **What Justifies the Premium/Discount? (Bull Case)**
   - List metrics where target ranks #1 or #2
   - Quantify the outperformance (e.g., "5x better ROE than peer average")
   - Explain if these strengths justify the current valuation multiple
   - Provide specific numbers and comparisons

4. **Where Target is Weaker (Bear Case)**
   - List metrics where target ranks #3 or #4 (worst)
   - Quantify the underperformance vs peers
   - Explain if these weaknesses create risk for the current multiple
   - Highlight structural concerns (leverage, size, margins, etc.)

5. **Analyst Sentiment: The Market's View**
   - Compare recent analyst activity (upgrades, downgrades, maintains) across all companies
   - Identify which peer is getting the most positive attention (upgrades)
   - Explain what this tells us about market sentiment and momentum
   - Note if there's a disconnect between fundamentals and analyst tone

6. **Peer-by-Peer Comparison Matrix**
   For EACH peer, create a comparison table with:
   - P/E, ROE, Revenue Growth, Net Margin, Market Cap, Debt/Equity
   - Declare a "winner" for each metric
   - Provide a **Trading Verdict** at the end of each comparison
   - Identify if there's a clear better trade or if it's a toss-up

7. **The Key Question: Is the Current Valuation Justified?**
   - List 4-5 bull case arguments (with ✅)
   - List 4-5 bear case arguments (with ❌)
   - Weigh both sides and conclude if premium/discount is sustainable

8. **Swing Trading Playbook (3 Scenarios)**
   
   **SCENARIO 1: The Compression/Expansion Trade**
   - Probability: X%
   - Thesis: (explain expected mean reversion)
   - Entry triggers: (specific conditions)
   - Trade setup: (long/short/puts/calls)
   - Target levels: (3 price/multiple targets with % moves)
   - Stop-loss: (specific level)
   - Expected timeline: (in quarters or months)

   **SCENARIO 2: The Pairs Trade**
   - Probability: X%
   - Thesis: (explain relative value opportunity)
   - Trade setup: (short X / long Y with rationale)
   - Target spread: (quantify spread compression/expansion)
   - Why this works: (3-4 bullet points)
   - Stop-loss: (spread level that invalidates thesis)

   **SCENARIO 3: The Momentum/Contrarian Trade**
   - Probability: X%
   - Thesis: (explain breakout or reversal setup)
   - Entry triggers: (specific catalysts needed)
   - Trade setup: (direction and instruments)
   - Target: (upside with % gains)
   - Stop-loss: (specific level)
   - Why low/high probability: (explain risks)

9. **Critical Events to Monitor**
   
   **HIGHEST PRIORITY:**
   - Next earnings date (specify what to watch)
   - Peer earnings dates (for relative comparison)
   - Industry-specific catalysts (sector-dependent)

   **SECONDARY MONITORING:**
   - Macro events that impact the sector
   - Company-specific risk factors (leverage, regulation, etc.)
   - Technical levels or trend changes

10. **The Numbers That Matter Most**
    
    **For LONG Trades (bullish setup):**
    - ✅ Metric 1: threshold/direction
    - ✅ Metric 2: threshold/direction
    - ✅ Metric 3: threshold/direction
    - ✅ Metric 4: threshold/direction

    **For SHORT Trades (bearish setup):**
    - ❌ Metric 1: threshold/direction
    - ❌ Metric 2: threshold/direction
    - ❌ Metric 3: threshold/direction
    - ❌ Metric 4: threshold/direction

11. **Bottom Line: How to Trade {target_symbol}**
    
    Create a summary table:
    | Scenario | Probability | Action | Target | Risk/Reward |
    |----------|-------------|--------|--------|-------------|
    | [Scenario name] | [%] | [Long/Short/Pairs] | [% gain/loss] | [ratio] |

    **Recommended Positions:**
    - If you own {target_symbol}: (action plan)
    - If you're considering entry: (wait conditions or entry zones)
    - Best risk/reward trade: (pairs trade or specific setup)

12. **Final Verdict**
    - One sentence: Is this OVERVALUED, UNDERVALUED, or FAIRLY VALUED?
    - One paragraph: Which peer offers better risk/reward right now and why?
    - One sentence: Clear actionable recommendation (buy/sell/wait/pairs trade)

## STYLE GUIDELINES

1. **Use tables and formatting for clarity**
   - Comparison tables for peer metrics
   - Bullet points for key insights
   - Bold for emphasis on critical numbers
   - ✅ and ❌ for bull/bear cases

2. **Be specific with numbers**
   - Always include actual values, not just qualitative statements
   - Show calculations (e.g., "39.28x vs 31.39x = 25% premium")
   - Provide multiple scenarios with quantified outcomes

3. **Focus on actionable trading setups**
   - Every scenario needs entry, target, stop-loss, and timeline
   - Explain WHY each scenario has its probability
   - Provide specific triggers and catalysts

4. **Maintain swing trader perspective**
   - Time horizon: 1-12 months (not day trading, not buy-and-hold)
   - Focus on technical + fundamental catalysts
   - Risk management is paramount (stops, position sizing)

5. **Use peer comparisons throughout**
   - Never analyze the target in isolation
   - Always reference peers for context
   - Identify which peer is the "better trade" alternative

6. **Avoid generic advice**
   - No "consider your risk tolerance" platitudes
   - No "consult a financial advisor" disclaimers
   - Give specific, actionable recommendations

7. **Tone: Direct, confident, data-driven**
   - Write like a professional trader talking to another trader
   - Be opinionated but support with data
   - Use phrases like "The trade here is...", "Your edge is...", "Bottom line..."
