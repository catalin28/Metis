Validate business logic and mathematical relationships in competitive intelligence report for {symbol}.

**Report Data to Validate:**
{report_data}

**Validation Requirements:**

1. **Mathematical Consistency**
   - Valuation gap = fundamental component + narrative component
   - Rankings sum correctly (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 for 5 companies)
   - Percentiles fall within 0-100 range
   - Growth rates calculated consistently

2. **Business Rule Validation**
   - P/E ratios must be positive (exclude companies with losses)
   - Combined ratios: reasonable range (70-130% for insurance)
   - ROE calculations: Net Income / Average Shareholders Equity
   - Market cap = Share price Ã— Shares outstanding

3. **Cross-Section Consistency**
   - Same peer group across all sections
   - Consistent financial data across metrics
   - Timeline alignment for all calculations
   - Symbol references match throughout

4. **Logical Relationships**
   - Higher ROE generally supports higher P/E ratios
   - Lower combined ratios should correlate with higher valuations
   - Growth rates should align with revenue progression
   - Debt levels should impact risk assessments

5. **Recommendation Alignment**
   - Recommendations address identified weaknesses
   - Action items align with analysis findings
   - Priority rankings match impact assessments
   - Timeline feasibility for implementation

**Validation Checks:**

**Critical Errors (Block Report Generation):**
- Mathematical inconsistencies in core calculations
- Missing required sections or fields
- Invalid data types or ranges
- Symbol mismatches across sections

**Warnings (Flag for Review):**
- Unusual metric relationships
- Outlier values requiring explanation
- Incomplete peer data affecting analysis
- Timeline inconsistencies
